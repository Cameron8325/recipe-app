      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi there! I'm Cameron Smith, a full stack web developer who finds joy in
        crafting robust and interactive web applications. My journey into web
        development began in school, where I developed a passion for coding and
        solving complex problems. I have honed my skills in both front-end and
        back-end development, mastering languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        and Python.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am proficient in various frameworks and libraries, including React,
        Node.js, and Django. These tools have enabled me to build dynamic and
        responsive applications. I am a continuous learner, always eager to stay
        abreast of the latest technologies and trends in the web development
        world. Tackling new challenges and working on innovative projects
        excites me.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy exploring topics related to space,
        indulging in video games, and listening to music. Balancing work and
        personal life is important to me, as it helps maintain my creativity and
        productivity. I am enthusiastic about bringing my skills and passion for
        web development to collaborative projects. Let's connect and create
        something remarkable together!
